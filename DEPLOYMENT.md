# Deployment Guide - Vercel & GitHub

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free tier works)
- Git installed on your computer

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

### If you haven't initialized git yet:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with all features"
```

### Create a new repository on GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository (e.g., `dispatch-manager`)
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Push your code:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dispatch-manager.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Using Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Click "Deploy" (no configuration needed)
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
7. Your app is live! ðŸŽ‰

### Option B: Using Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

## Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

## Step 4: Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

Vercel automatically provides HTTPS for all deployments. No configuration needed!

## Step 5: Test PWA Installation

### On Mobile:
1. Open your deployed URL in Chrome/Safari
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Install and test offline functionality

### On Desktop:
1. Open in Chrome
2. Look for install icon in address bar
3. Click to install as desktop app

## Updating Your App

### After making changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy your app within 1-2 minutes!

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not working:
- Ensure you're accessing via HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically)
- Check browser permissions
- Try different browser

### PWA not installing:
- Clear browser cache
- Check manifest.json is accessible at `/manifest.json`
- Verify service worker is registered in DevTools

### Data not persisting:
- Check browser's localStorage is enabled
- Don't use incognito/private mode
- Check browser storage quota

## Environment Variables (If needed in future)

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Add your variables
4. Redeploy

## Monitoring

- View deployment logs in Vercel dashboard
- Check Analytics tab for usage stats
- Monitor errors in browser console

## Support

For issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all files are committed to GitHub
3. Check Vercel deployment logs
4. Ensure HTTPS is enabled

## Your Live URLs

After deployment, you'll get:
- Production: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- Preview: Automatic preview URLs for each commit
- Custom domain: If configured

**Note**: First deployment might take 2-3 minutes. Subsequent deployments are faster (30-60 seconds).
